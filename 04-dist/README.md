# 04-dist (Node SEA demo)

Bundles a Node.js app into a single Windows executable using **SEA** (Single Executable Apps).
Reads `config.json` (bundled as a SEA resource) and writes `users.json` at runtime.

## Prereqs
- Windows
- Node.js 22+ (SEA is most reliable here)
- PowerShell
- `postject` (added as dev dependency)

## Dev
```bash
npm start
